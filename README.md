Aina
====
A bash script for OSX love
--------------------------

Aina is a bash script with aliases and commands to make your dev work a little bit faster. 
Still working on it.

**Please notice: this script is under development so shit could happen. Use it at your own risk.**. However: 

### Installation
1. Either download the files and place them manually in user/aina or simply `$ git clone https://github.com/carlesjove/aina.git ~/aina`

2. Include Aina in your .bash_profile:
`source ~/aina/aina`

### How to use
Launch Terminal and type `aina [command]`

TODO: write list of current commands!

### Working examples
1. Create a new WordPress complete installation
`$ aina wp install`

2. Generate a WordPress Post Type for your theme
`$ aina wp generate -pt`

3. Create a new [X] project from a code repo
`$ aina new [repo]`

Please note that you must have a repo in a `_new` directory within Aina. Example: ~/aina/_new/wordpress

4. Visit some website
`$ aina go example.com`

Contribute
----------
Aina is my first bash script, so it might be clumsy. Wanna contribute or help me imporve it? Either send me an email or open an issue. I'll be glad to hear from you.
